# Installation

## Stable release

To install `jwskate`, run this command in your terminal:

```console
$ pip install jwskate
```

This is the preferred method to install `jwskate`, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip] installed, this [Python installation guide] can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for `jwskate` can be downloaded from the [Github repo].

You can either clone the public repository:

```console
$ git clone git://github.com/guillp/jwskate
```

Or download the [tarball]:

```console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/guillp/jwskate/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```console
$ pip install .
```
